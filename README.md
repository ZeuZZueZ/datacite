# DataCite

DataCite is a leading global non-profit organisation that provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) for research data. Our goal is to help the research community locate, identify, and cite research data with confidence.

### About this repository

This is the generic DataCite repository for bugs, enhancements, and other issues. DataCite users can add their ideas through the [DataCite Roadmap](https://datacite.org/roadmap.html).

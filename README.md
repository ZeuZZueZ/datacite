# DataCite 

DataCite is a leading global non-profit organisation that provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) for research data. Our goal is to help the research community locate, identify, and cite research data with confidence.

### About this repository

This is the DataCite repository for user stories, new features, enhancements, and other issues. DataCite users can add their ideas through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/datacite/datacite/issues/new) or on our [Waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/datacite/datacite).

Our Issues are grouped into [GitHib Milestones](https://github.com/datacite/datacite/milestones), and these Milestones provide an overview of our plans for the rest of the year.
